W2W Buglist
Music plays again so two tracks are heard at once after game restart - seems fixed with dispose() addition
Music plays after app is closed - seems fixed with dispose() addition
Drone position updating is incorrect, results in collision above drone enemy - fixed x and y change values and added new bound rects
Jump Type - Jump 1 looks much slower than jump 3 based on arc differences - inputted differing velocities based on jump type
Enemy falling rates can seem laggy/unpredictable -> try to remove extra speed when char jumps
Player and enemy movement can seem laggy -> find optimizations
DroneEnemy new pattern with current velocity seems to slow down game and cause player to wait on wall -
Game screen after death can sometimes be unresponsive -
Four enemies spawned at the same time rather than staggered as in SpawnTimer.class - NOT REPRODUCIBLE -
