W2W Buglist
Music plays again so two tracks are heard at once after game restart - seems fixed with dispose() addition
Music plays after app is closed - seems fixed with dispose() addition
Drone position updating is incorrect, results in collision above drone enemy - fixed x and y change values and added new bound rects
Jump Type - Jump 1 looks much slower than jump 3 based on arc differences - inputted differing velocities based on jump type
Enemy falling rates can seem laggy/unpredictable -> try to remove extra speed when char jumps - enemy speed now unchanged by player1.jumping boolean
Player and enemy movement can seem laggy -> find optimizations
DroneEnemy new pattern with current velocity seems to slow down game and cause player to wait on wall -
Game screen after death can sometimes be unresponsive -
Four enemies spawned at the same time rather than staggered as in SpawnTimer.class - NOT REPRODUCIBLE -
Current line 45 in MainMenuScreen (Input.TouchEvent event = touchEvents.get(touchEventIndex);) gives IndexOutOfBoundsException: Invalid index 1, size is 0 -
WallHazards keep spawning after array completion - Incorrectly commented code needed to refresh bool states
WallHazards can be adjacent, and are then impossible to surpass -> Add checks, if botleftlow=true, botrightlow!=true - Fixed mistake in variable placement
Errors due to MediaPlayer -
Game unpaused from home screen then immediately transformed to lvl 2 and spawned many enemies -> Seems as if game_start_time was not correctly updated with total time paused - checked call to pause upon loss of focus and removed resume call
Game unpauses immediately from home screen - INCOMPLETE -> Commented call to screen.resume in onResume method of AndrFastRendView.java
Game does not pause when recent apps button is pressed (app loses focus), and game_start_time continues - checked call to pause upon loss of focus and removed resume call
Current line 902 in GameScreen (Input.TouchEvent event = touchEvents.get(touchEventIndex);) gives IndexOutOfBoundsException: Invalid index 1, size is 0 -
WallHazard Objects disappear upon level change, but collision objects remain - added call to clear method of hazardboundsarray upon level change, reset top/bot-left/right-high/low bools to false
WallHazard Objects appear upon level change, but no collision objects are made - reset top/bot-left/right-high/low bools to false
Pressing resume from pause causes an instant jump - added update to delay_time bool so 200ms wait for next jump is required
